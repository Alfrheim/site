Software Craftsmanship is at the core of everything we do.

*We:*

**build quality software** for our clients. We firmly believe that software should increasingly deliver more value and become more flexible with time. We achieve this by continuously investing in our skills and tools required to build quality software.

**focus on collaboration** by recognising that software is not built just by developers. It is a result of the collaboration between all stakeholders. We ensure collaboration and communication is at the heart of software development.

**inject passion into teams** by mentoring and educating developers, testers and business analysts. We help them engage with the talent that exists in vibrant professional communities.

**invest in the community** by engaging and organising software craftsmanship communities and community events world wide.
