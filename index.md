Software Craftsmanship is at the heart of everything we do.

*We:*

**build quality software** for our clients. We firmly believe that software should increasingly deliver more value and become more flexible with time. We achieve this by continuously investing in our skills and tools required to build quality software.

**focus on collaboration** by recognising that software is not built just by developers. It is a result of the collaboration between all stakeholders. We ensure collaboration and communication is at the heart of software development for our clients.

**inject passion into teams** by mentoring and educating developers, testers, business analysts and product owners. We help them engage with the wider IT community in order to benefit from the best of bread practices, technologies and experiences.

**invest in the community** by engaging and organising software craftsmanship communities and events world wide, and by helping to bring these communities into the workplace.
