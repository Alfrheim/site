            <p>Codurance is a Software Consultancy based on the Software Craftsmanship principles. Software Craftsmanship
                is a movement that aims to bring professionalism to our industry. It's main principles are highlighted in the Software Craftsmanship manifesto:
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only working software, but also <strong>well-crafted software.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only responding to change but also <strong>steadily adding value.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only individuals and interactions but also a <strong>community of professionals.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only customer collaboration but also <strong>productive partnerships</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            </p>
            <p>Following the Software Craftsmanship principles we are constantly seeking ways to add value to the team,
                resulting in observable constant improvements in technology and working practices. Our craftsmen are always
                engaged with the wider IT community and bring the best of that learning to their workplace. Working from
                within the team makes them highly effective in bringing about positive change and innovation.</p>

            <p>We work very well embedded in projects with client staff in order to help nurture autonomous highly
                effective teams.
                Our wide-ranging expertise in technologies and practices ensure that the right decisions are made
                especially during the early phases of a project.
