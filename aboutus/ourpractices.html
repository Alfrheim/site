	    <p>Software Craftsmanship is at the heart of everything we do so we can continuously deliver value to the business with inherent quality. We understand that quality should not be a premium. We hone our skills through continuous practice. We constantly learn, teach and mentor in our team, our company and the wider software development industry.</p>

	    <h3 class="subject-header margin-bottom-40">Agile and Lean Software Development</h3>
	    <p>We believe that a good process constantly delivers incremental value to the business and provides fast feedback. This allows us to inspect, learn, and adapt so that we are able to constantly improve. We don't prescribe specific processes. We help teams understand their options and make their own choices - whether that is Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of Agile practices.</p>

	    <h3 class="subject-header margin-bottom-40">Continuous Delivery</h3>
	    <p>We understand that Continuous Delivery requires the organisation to be aligned in order to deliver value to stakeholders in frequent and small iterations. We are experts in release automation and setting up continuous delivery pipelines. Releasing often is easy, but releasing defect-free features that are aligned to the business is not. We achieve continuous delivery through close attention to business needs, software quality, and Extreme Programming (XP) practices.</p>

	    <h3 class="subject-header margin-bottom-40">Extreme Programming</h3>
	    <p>Practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), Pair Programming, Continuous Integration and Shared Ownership are core to everyone at Codurance. This fits very well with our craftsmanship values. We are renowned experts in these practices and use them with great effect to constantly deliver value to our clients. We love to teach and run public training courses and community events to help our industry embed these practices into their teams.</p>
