	    <p>Software Craftsmanship is at the heart of everything we do. We believe that the value of craftsmanship is in continuously delivering value to the business with inherent quality. We understand that quality should not be a premium. We hone our skills through continuous practice. We constantly learn, teach and mentor in our team, our company, and in the wider software development industry.</p>

	    <p>We believe that a good process constantly delivers incremental value to the business and provides a short feedback cycle. The short feedback allows us to inspect, learn, and adapt so that we are constantly improve the way we deliver. We donâ€™t prescribe specific process but help the teams to understand their options and make their own choices - whether that is Scrum, Kanban, or a mix of Agile practices.</p>

	    <h3 class="subject-header margin-bottom-40">Continuous Delivery</h3>
	    <p>We understand that Continuous Delivery requires the whole organisation be aligned in order to deliver value to the business in frequent and small iterations. We are experts in release automation and setting up continuous delivery pipelines. Releasing often is easy but releasing defect free features that are aligned to the business, is not easy. We achieve continuous delivery through close attention to business needs, software quality, and Extreme Programming practices.</p>
