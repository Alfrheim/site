                <h3><a>Samir Talwar</a> <small>Software Craftsman</small></h3>
                <p>Samir Talwar is a developer who’s focused on two things: doing the right things in the right way. A member of the London Software Craftsmanship Community, he tries to help people (including himself) challenge their definitions of “good enough” by running workshops, pairing with anyone and everyone and constantly asking questions. He’s a firm believer in using the right tool for the job, and constantly tries to remind people (including himself) that the job in question is never as small as they think it is. Samir has bounced through different industries, starting in web development, then wandering into the finance world. His work as part of the Software Craftsmanship movement is focused on trying to improve himself as fast as possible.</p>
