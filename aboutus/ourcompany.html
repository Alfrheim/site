            <p>Software Craftsmanship principles are at the heart of our company. Software Craftsmanship
                is a movement that aims to bring professionalism to our industry. It's main principles are highlighted in the Software Craftsmanship manifesto:</p>
            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only working software, but also <strong>well-crafted software.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only responding to change but also <strong>steadily adding value.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only individuals and interactions but also a <strong>community of professionals.</strong></li>
                <li><i class="icon-certificate color-green"></i> Not only customer collaboration but also <strong>productive partnerships</strong></li>
            </ul>
            </p>
