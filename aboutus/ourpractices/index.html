                            We look at testing in a holistic fashion where all type of testing has a place in producing
                            good quality software that adds value. We make a distinction between testing that supports
                            the team (e.g. automated functional testing, unit testing etc.) verses testing that
                            critiques the product (e.g. performance testing, manual explorative functional testing
                            etc.).

                            Test Driven Development is a practice that is very hard to master. It not only requires
                            extensive practice but also a deep rooted understudying of good software design. We are
                            mindful that badly written tests can cause more harm than good and well written tests will
                            help keep the system flexible to change.

                            of working however the ultimate decision as to how the system is designed, what framework
                            library we use lies with the team. The technical architected should be an active member of
                            the team and influence on the basis of his/her reputation as a developer.

                            environment where it was originally thought that DevOps is not possible.

                            How a team organises it works should be left to the team. If they are not experienced with
                            the Agile processes then a mentor can help them adapt a process to their needs. We have
                            years of experience applying Agile processes such and Scrum and Kanban. We find they are
                            best utilised when tailored to individual teams according to their needs. If project has a
                            number of teams then we have found the following to be invaluable regardless of the process:

                            Daily Team Standup, Daily Across Team Standup and Regular Team and Across Team
                            Retrospectives.
