#### Introduction

It's been nearly two months since I have joined 'Codurance', a formidable force, and its about time that I share my experiences with my fellow mates and the community around me.

During my first few weeks at Codurance, I have been busy learning various things that have been chalked out for becoming a craftsman.

Among the various katas I have been doing, the Gilded Rose Kata [[blog](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/)|[requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)|[github](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)] is one of them.

In the process I learnt a lot of refactoring techniques, design principles and gotchas, and using various libraries and methods to write tests.


#### Setup and environment
When working on anything or learning something, I was able to do these (in no particular order):
- pair and mob programming with my colleagues
- use [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) whilst refactoring and writing tests (both working on my own and with the other colleagues)
- had a lot of discussions and retrospectives after working on a problem or writing something from scratch

It is a privilege to be able to work alongside very experienced craftspersons from our industry. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to be guided and mentored by talented and like minded developers.

This is one of my first jobs where the company has a completely flat hierarchy and where we have similar values amongst ourselves.

### Learning and collaborations

I found our office environment to be conducive to learning, sharing and collaboration. We even have a pairing rota that we use from time-to-time to record or suggest pairing sessions during the week.

And the apprentice meetings are full of fun -- we are accompanied by at least one craftsperson, who disperses their knowledge and experience from a wide variety of things designed to help us in the journey.


#### Closing note

Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope it was interesting. Looking forward to write more and share such experiences in future posts.
