### Some background

Some of you may know me from the various meetups in the city, especially my attendance at a number of LJC and LSCC meetup events. Attending these events I learnt about various conferences like Devoxx, SoCrates, Jax London, Java2Days, and some others, and have had the good fortune at being at such events and even presenting at some of them. My subject was usually around Adopt OpenJDK and Adopt-a-JSR whilst wearing my LJC hat, but I also took the chance to present other topics.

During this time I met a lot of people with various levels of experience and my interest and urge to learn more about the Java/JVM platform, quality code, software design, XP practices, Software Craftsmanship, etc..., were on the rise and saw no end. And whilst attending these events I met Sandro and Mash. I went to many of the LSCC events, especially the hands-on session (which are still my favourite) held in the evenings and sometimes during weekends.

I also noticed that many things I learnt at such events and conferences wouldn't always immediately recognised or accepted at the workplace. And moving to another work environment didn't always solve this problem fully. I found that I wasn't learning and applying what I wanted to from my peers and very few were really in tuned with what the community was sharing. So one fine day I decided to take charge of my career and make a serious decision and take up the apprenticeship program offered by Codurance and go through the process.


### Where we are just now

It's now been nearly two months since I have been working for 'Codurance', a formidable force. And so its also about time that I share my experiences with my fellow mates and the community around me.

During my first few weeks at Codurance, I have been busy learning various things that have been chalked out for becoming a craftsman.

Among the various katas I have been doing, the Gilded Rose Kata [[blog](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/)|[requirements](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/master/GildedRoseRequirements.txt)|[github](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)] is one of them.

In the process I learnt a lot of refactoring techniques, design principles and gotchas, and using various libraries and methods to write tests.


### Setup and environment
When working on anything or learning something, I was able to do these (in no particular order):
 
 * pair and mob programming with my colleagues
 * use [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) whilst refactoring and writing tests (both working on my own and with the other colleagues)
 * had a lot of discussions and retrospectives after working on a problem or writing something from scratch

It is a privilege to be able to work alongside very experienced craftspersons from our industry. We are very lucky to have the opportunity to be guided and mentored by talented and like minded developers.

This is one of my first jobs where the company has a completely flat hierarchy and where we share similar values amongst ourselves. And the working hours are quite flexible, remote working is also something we can do given everything is on the cloud these days.


### Learning and collaborations

I found our office environment to be conducive to learning, sharing and collaboration. We even have a pairing rota that we use from time-to-time to record or suggest pairing sessions during the week.

Just last week we did a group code review and time-boxed ourselves, performed a retrospective at the end of each interval and ensured we delivered a good chunk of the feedback before close of play.

And the apprentice meetings are full of fun -- we are accompanied by at least one craftsperson, who disperses their knowledge and experience from a wide variety of things designed to help us in the journey.


### Sharing

We share links to interesting articles, videos, blog posts, etc... via slack, document discussions and brain dumps via google doc, huddles during tea-breaks to talk about anything we are working on. Thanks to the library of printed and digital books to our disposal. 

A bi-weekly catchup involves sharing of knowledge via lightening talks, discussions and pairing sessions on pet projects.


### Closing note

Work is fun and learning is enjoyable when we love what we do and are amongst friends with a collective mindset. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this post and I hope it was interesting. Looking forward to write more and share such experiences in future posts.

PS: I promise to stay away from pizzas (lets see how long I can hold on to this)
