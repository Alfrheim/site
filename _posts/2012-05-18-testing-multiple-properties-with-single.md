Every time I was trying to test an object's properties I was neither
satisfied writing very verbose tests nor in using some of the out of the
box hamcrest matchers. Although using the matchers was a big help, I
never managed to make them read the way I wanted.

Another thing that was very important to me, I wanted to have a single
assertion per method and a very descriptive description if the test did
not pass.

I've decided to write my own matcher and hopefully it will be useful to
other people. So, that's what I've done:

[BeanMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher)

Hamcrest matcher to match multiple attributes of an object within a
single assertion.

[How to use it](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher#how-to-use-it)


**NOTE**: Make sure you are usingÂ org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat
instead of the JUnit one.

If you run this test, you will get a message like


Now, change the age check to

{% highlight java %}
property("age", greaterThan(60))
{% endhighlight %}


And you should get:
{% highlight java %}
Testing object graphs
{% endhighlight %}

You can also do this

I use a combination of two matchers to do that:

[BeanMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher/blob/master/src/main/java/org/craftedsw/beanpropertymatcher/matcher/BeanMatcher.java):
Provides the "has" method responsible to group all the property
matchers.

[BeanPropertyMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher/blob/master/src/main/java/org/craftedsw/beanpropertymatcher/matcher/BeanPropertyMatcher.java):
Provides the "property" method.

I expect to make more changes to them, so for the most up-to-date
version, please check

Enjoy!!!
