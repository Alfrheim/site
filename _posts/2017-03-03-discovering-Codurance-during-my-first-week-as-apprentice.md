## Respect

Every morning, Sandro shakes hands with everyone when he arrives at the office. Everyday, everyone. I haven’t seen something similar in any company I’ve worked and it’s an incredible example of respect and consideration.

## Transparency

I’ve known all about the economic situation of the company, included salaries and salary reviews. This is an amazing example of transparency at all levels. 

## No offices, no assigned places

There are not independent offices, neither assigned places. An open space where you can sit wherever you want. This issue “breaks” both the attachment of a place and the separation between roles.

## Learning and friendly atmosphere

Skillshare meeting are organized continuously in a natural way and in a friendly atmosphere. 

## Having a buddy

It’s the first time I have a buddy designated to help me for my first days in a company. Not only he has got I feel “at home” in few minutes and he has been worried about my convenience, but also he has taught me a lot of things for this week (technical ones, time management, acquiring skills and a big amount of advices and smiles). 

## Having a mentor

I’ve found a mentor in previous companies, but never about technical skills and with a plan of skills acquisition. Now I have an amazing person (technically and personally) designated to help me with my apprenticeship. I have no words to describe what he provided me for the first session during this week. 

I’m living a dream and I hope not to wake up. Thanks for existing!
