I started at [Codurance](http://codurance.com/) a month and a half ago  as a C# developer. I was glad to have the opportunity to work in a place, where people value your effort to be a better developer. They set you some goals that you are expect to achieve on your own, with their support.

I was happy with my position, I had been away from C# for more than 4 years. This was for me a great opportunity to catch up with my main language. But my passion is with iOS. On my own time, I started to apply all the techniques that I focused especially on [honing my TDD skills](http://www.ananogal.com/blog/starting-your-tdd-journey/) and [applying TDD to iOS](http://codurance.com/2015/07/13/How-to-start-doing-TDD-in-iOS/).

And you think: Why did you apply for C# and not tried iOS? Well, I looked for 3 months for a iOS company that could give me an opportunity. It was really hard. They all wanted senior developers who could get there and got the job done. But I'm not at that level in iOS. I still have a lot to learn and I needed an opportunity to learn more from experienced developers. Exchange thoughts and understand how things work. I had that in C#, I've been in several clients, I knew how to address a problem, how I could put my expertise to help. That's not true in iOS. And that's what I missed from my journey in the world of apps. To have this kind of experience. And you thinking: didn't you develop 4 apps? Didn't you pass for all the desperate days of deployment for the AppStore? Yes, I did! But, I was my client, and the developer. It started like a small pet project that got big enough for me to stay at home for 4 years and try to make it work.  I missed the experience exchange  in a team. The great discussions that a subject can lead to... This is what makes you grow in your profession.

So 2 weeks ago, [Sandro](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso) mentioned they had an opportunity in iOS.  Could I pursue my dream? A client  was willing to have me as an apprentice, if I could pass the interview. Oh my God!!!!! I was thrilled!!!!!! Given a choice between IOS or C#, I choose iOS. But I never thought that Codurance would try and fulfil my dream. I can definitely be more profitable in C# than in iOS, but Codurance choose to give me an opportunity to grow in iOS.

Codurance is again a company that I want to be in. I had that feeling with my first job were I stayed for 7 years. I still say "my company", when I'm talking about them with friends. Since then I've work in several companies not only in Portugal but also in Spain were I lived for 10 years. None of them made me feel a team member or cared about my opinions. And made me want to be a better person not only a better developer.
Oh! by the way, I've done the interview and I'll start next week. ;).

So this last 2 weeks I reviewed all I've learned for C#, and applied it to Objective-C. I've been learning a lot! Just doing katas, that made me investigate and find out a lot of new things and paths. But that will be the topic for another blog post.

So if you have a dream and you can't pursue it right away, don't loose the passion for it, and never ever put it in a drawer.
