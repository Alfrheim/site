Testing multiple properties with single assertion time: 2012-05-18

Every time I was trying to test an object's properties I was neither
satisfied writing very verbose tests nor in using some of the out of the
box hamcrest matchers. Although using the matchers was a big help, I
never managed to make them read the way I wanted. \
\
Another thing that was very important to me, I wanted to have a single
assertion per method and a very descriptive description if the test did
not pass.\
\
I've decided to write my own matcher and hopefully it will be useful to
other people. So, that's what I've done:\

[BeanMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hamcrest matcher to match multiple attributes of an object within a
single assertion.\

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\

**NOTE**: Make sure you are usingÂ org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat
instead of the JUnit one.\
\
If you run this test, you will get a message like\

\
Now, change the age check to \

>        property("age", greaterThan(60)) 

And you should get:\
\

\

Testing object graphs {style="text-align: left;"}
---------------------

You can also do this\
\

I use a combination of two matchers to do that:\
-
[BeanMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher/blob/master/src/main/java/org/craftedsw/beanpropertymatcher/matcher/BeanMatcher.java):
Provides the "has" method responsible to group all the property
matchers. \
-
[BeanPropertyMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher/blob/master/src/main/java/org/craftedsw/beanpropertymatcher/matcher/BeanPropertyMatcher.java):
Provides the "property" method.\
\
I expect to make more changes to them, so for the most up-to-date
version, please check
[BeanMatcher](https://github.com/sandromancuso/bean-property-matcher) on
[my github account](https://github.com/sandromancuso). \
\
Enjoy!!!
