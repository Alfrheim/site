                        <h2>Does TDD really lead to good design?</h2>
                        <p>“TDD is a design tool.” That’s what I’ve said for years. But not anymore. After working with different teams in different organisations, I realised that I don’t believe anymore that TDD is a design tool. In this talk I’ll be explaining the pros and cons of the two main styles of TDD, discuss why some developers can test-drive well-crafted code while others can’t, and also explain how to reason about design decisions.

                        <p>For more about the differences between TDD styles, please check Sandro's blog post <a href="http://codurance.com/2015/05/12/does-tdd-lead-to-good-design/">Does TDD really lead to good design?</p>

                        <h2>Screencast - Oustide-In TDD (part III)</h2>
                        <p>Different from the previous screencasts, this one is not meant for TDD beginners. Inspired by recent <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso/status/588503877235781632"> discussions on Twitter</a> and a public discussion about TDD and Software Design (see video below), Sandro Mancuso decided to record a video showing how he normally codes, which is different from how he normally teaches.</p>

                        <p>In this 3-part screencast you will be able to follow Sandro's "just in time" design approach and understand the rationale behind some of his recent comments. You will notice that he not always follow rules and how he relies more on his intuition to drive his design. Thinking out loud throughout the video, it becomes quite easy to understand everything that he is considering while writing each test and refactoring his code. This video provides a very good example of Outside-In TDD and how it differs from the Classicist approach.</p>

                        <p>If you are TDD novice, don't follow the advice from these videos blindly. Favour the classicist approach, design less up-front, and get feedback from your code before evolving your design.</p>

However twitter is not the best place to host these kind of discussions it's better to talk. Sandro and JB will discuss and answer questions face to face in this hangout organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/carlosble">Carlos Ble</a>.</p>

                        <p>Does TDD mean no up-front design at all? Should everything emerge as we test-drive? What about architecture?...</p>

                        <p>How can we quickly tell what an application is about? How can we quickly tell what it does? How can we distinguish business concepts from architecture clutter? How can we quickly find the code we want to change? How can we instinctively know where to add code for new features? Purely looking at unit tests is either not possible or too painful. Looking at higher-level tests can take a long time and still not give us the answers we need. For years, we have all struggled to design and structure projects that reflect the business domain.</p>

Sandro will also be touching on SOLID principles, Agile incremental design, modularisation, and testing strategies. By iteratively modifying the project structure to better model the product requirements, he has come up with a design style that helps developers create maintainable and domain-oriented software.</p>
