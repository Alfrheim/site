            <h2>Crafted Design</h2>

            <p>How can we quickly tell what an application is about? How can we quickly tell what it does? How can we distinguish business concepts from architecture clutter? How can we quickly find the code we want to change? How can we instinctively know where to add code for new features? Purely looking at unit tests is either not possible or too painful. Looking at higher-level tests can take a long time and still not give us the answers we need. For years, we have all struggled to design and structure projects that reflect the business domain.</p>

            <p>In these slides Sandro shares how he designed the last application he worked on, twisting a few concepts from Domain-Driven Design, properly applying MVC, borrowing concepts from CQRS, and structuring packages in non-conventional ways. Sandro will also be touching on SOLID principles, Agile incremental design, modularisation, and testing. By iteratively modifying the project structure to better model the product requirements, he has come up with a design style that helps developers create maintainable and domain-oriented software.</p>

            <h2> Curing the Agile Hangover </h2>

            <p>This project started life with a waterfall process. The teams were divided by components with dedicated
                teams for business analysts and testing.</p>

            <p>When we joined, the project had a number of issues including: Stagnate Skill set, Low Moral, Lots of
                Technical Debt, Unreliable and Costly Automated Tests, Unstable System, Unreliable Release Process and
                ineffective Off-shore teams.</p>

            <p>We led a programme that focused on steadily improving the system as well as the team. We also brought the
                offshore teams closer to the point where they were considered an equal to the central on shore teams.

            <h2> TDD at Scale </h2>

            <p>Test Driven Development is a practice generally endorsed by most people. However it is also one of the
                most difficult to get right. We applied TDD in a very large project. We encountered a number of
                challenges and learned a lot of lessons. We discovered that doing TDD badly is actually worse than not
                doing TDD at
                all and that it is very important to get some basics rights otherwise you'll put yourself in a world of
                pain.</p>

            <p>This case study highlights the lessons we learned and the basics that are absolutely crucial for
                practicing TDD successfully.</p>
