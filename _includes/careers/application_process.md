### I want to apply. What do I need to do?

#### First phase

We don't read boring CVs, but we love interesting stories. If you think Codurance is for you, **drop us a line at [hello@codurance.com](mailto:hello@codurance.com)** with a brief description of who you are. Things we want to hear about include:

  * How passionate are you about software?
  * What does software craftsmanship mean to you?
  * With which technologies are you comfortable?
  * Which technologies are you currently learning?
  * Which technologies would you like to learn?
  * What are your favourite technical books / blogs?
  * Which technical communities do you **actively** participate in?
  * Have you spoken at or attended any conferences? Which ones?
  * Are there any pet projects you are working on? Tell us about them. And relax; we promise not to steal your ideas and won't tell anyone.

We also want links. Lots of links. If you have any of the following, send them along.

  * any blog posts, articles or books you've written
  * your [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account
  * any open-source projects you've worked on
  * any pet projects you're particularly proud of
  * your [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/) profile
  * links to any applications you've worked on that are publicly available
  * anything available online that can help us know more about you

#### Second Phase

We will send you requirements for a very small application, which you will need to implement. You have complete freedom over the languages and tools you use.

#### Third Phase

If we liked your code, we will invite you in to meet us and pair with us for a few hours. You will need to bring your own laptop, set up with your favourite language, development environment, libraries and tools. (If you don't have a laptop, just let us know.)
