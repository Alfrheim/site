# Apprentice

### What is an apprenticeship?

An apprenticeship under Codurance is a process of learning. Guided by a dedicated mentor, you will hone the skills that are absolutely essential for a software craftsman.

Different people have different abilities. You're probably quite experienced in some facets of software development, but have little exposure in others. As part of your apprenticeship, you'll learn:

  * the intricacies in **crafting code** that is simple, clean, maintainable and easy to reason about
  * how to orient your **software design** around business domains
  * **confidence** in your code that comes from applying Extreme Programming practices
  * software development **methodologies** that facilitate craftsmanship, including Agile and Lean
  * **paradigms** and **design patterns** we apply to our code to clarify its intent
  * the mentality behind **Test-Driven Development** and how we test our code
  * the full **development lifecycle**, from your first print statement to a full system living in a production environment
  * **speaking** and **negotiating** skills, to allow you to convey your ideas about how to approach a solution
  * **tools** and **libraries** that help us become better at our craft

You won't be doing this alone. Your mentor will take responsibility for helping you grow and pushing your boundaries. What you learn, though, is really **up to you**: you'll decide what you'd like to focus upon and how you'd like to approach it.

### How long is an apprenticeship, and what happens afterwards?

An apprenticeship is flexible; we expect it to take somewhere between three and six months, but depending on experience, it can be longer or shorter. The duration doesn't matter to us, as long as you're learning. Once we're happy that you can work with our customers to the standard set by our existing craftsmen, you'll be offered a brand new contract as a craftsman at Codurance.

### What are you looking for in an apprentice?

We abide by a set of values, and are looking for apprentices who understand why. We want people who have:

  * the willingness to learn
  * an openness to new ideas
  * passion for technology and code
  * curiosity when encountering new concepts and tools
  * a flexible approach
  * the desire to create things of the highest quality

You should be proficient in software development, but you don't necessarily need to have worked professionally. A lot of the skills and practices you will learn are not common even in industrial settings, which is part of the reason we can have such an impact with our customers.

### Why do you take on apprentices?

It's unlikely that a practitioner of the craft of software development has been exposed to everything that a career as a software craftsman demands. An experienced craftsman can work with an entire business to transform their approach to software design, development, modelling, testing and more.

We are looking for apprentices because we feel the skills and mindset required of a software craftsman are more than those needed for the average software developer. By training each and every craftsman, we can ensure you are capable of tackling the biggest challenges.
