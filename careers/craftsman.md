# Software Craftsman

### What type of developers are you looking for?

You consider yourself a software **crafter**. You care about and are **proud** of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.

**T**est-**D**riven **D**evelopment is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use "lack of time" as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.

You are a **team player**. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.

As a **passionate** developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.

As part of the learning process, you consider it important to **share** what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.

You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job **without being religious** about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms, user interface libraries and development environments.

You understand and embrace **Agile** processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.

You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of **SOLID** principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and **D**omain-**D**riven **D**esign to design applications that reflect the business domain.

If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are **definitely interested in hearing from you**.

### What is expected from a craftsman at Codurance?

As a craftsman at Codurance, you are expected to do many of the following activities:

  * Build well-crafted bespoke applications to clients.
  * Lead by example: You strive to work at your best, you don't cut corners, and you always behave with professionalism, regardless of which environment you are in.
  * Work with fellow craftsmen and our clients, helping them to get better at delivering quality software.
  * Travel outside London, although this will be an exception and we will always try to keep that to a minimum. The vast majority of our clients are based in London, but as a consultancy company, we may have clients in different places. We value our personal lives as much as we value our professional lives.
  * Mentor apprentices: You will be responsible for helping apprentices to become craftsmen. Although the biggest part of this mentorship will happen during working hours, be prepared to spend a few extra hours on this.
  * Become proficient in multiple languages and technologies.
  * Give something back to the community, writing blogs, sharing code, giving talks, running workshops, and participating in external technical communities, specially the [London Software Craftsmanship Community (LSCC)](http://londonswcraft.com).
  * Be humble, always respecting, sharing knowledge with, and learning from developers regardless of their skill and experience, whether they are part of Codurance or not.

### What are the advantages of being a craftsman at Codurance?

  * Exposure to many different projects, clients, industries, and technologies.
  * Be part of an amazing team of craftsmen, which guarantees that you will always be learning.
  * Work for a company with a flat structure, with no managers, no architects, and no team leaders. Just awesome developers.
  * You are recognised and respected for being a great developer.
  * Flexible working hours. As long as there is no disruption to the projects and the team agrees, you can work wherever and whenever you like.

### What technologies do you use?

We use whatever is fit for purpose. We love trying new things and experimenting. The majority of our clients currently use Java and/or C#. Strong knowledge in at least one of the them is always an advantage but not essential.

### I want to apply. What do I need to do?

#### First phase

We don't read boring CVs. If you think Codurance is for you, **drop us a line at [hello@codurance.com](mailto:hello@codurance.com)** with a brief description of who you are. Things we care about include:

  * How passionate are you about software?
  * What does software craftsmanship mean to you?
  * With which technologies are you comfortable?
  * Which technologies are you currently learning?
  * Which technologies would you like to learn?
  * What are your favourite technical books / blogs?
  * Which technical communities do you **actively** participate in?
  * Have you spoken at or attended any conferences? Which ones?
  * Are there any pet projects you are working on? Tell us about them. And relax; we promise not to steal your ideas and won't tell anyone.

We also want links. Lots of links. If you have any of the following, send them along.

  * A blog
  * Any books you've written
  * Your Twitter account
  * Any open-source projects you've worked on
  * Any pet projects you're particularly proud of
  * Your [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) profile
  * Links to any applications you built that are publicly available
  * Anything available online that can help us know more about you

#### Second Phase

We are going to send you some requirements and you will need to implement a small applicationâ€”slightly bigger than a kata. It can be done in a few hours, maybe a day. You choose which language and tools you want to use.

#### Third Phase

If we liked your code, we will be inviting you in to meet us and to pair with us for a few hours. You will need to bring your own laptop with your favourite language, development environment, libraries and tools all set up. (If you don't have a laptop, just let us know.)
