            <h3>What type of developers are you looking for?</h3>

            <p>We are looking for developers with the following mindset:</p>

            <p>You consider yourself a software crafter. You care about and are <strong>proud of the code you write</strong>. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to clients via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.</p>

            <p><strong>T</strong>est-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You'd don't use "lack of time" as an excuse to do a bad job. You love pair programming and that is your preferred way to write code.</p>

            <p>As a <strong>passionate developer</strong>, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your career, learning new technologies, practicing different techniques and approaches, and above all, <strong>sharing what you know</strong> with others. You don't do it because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.</p>

            <p>You probably have a blog, some code on GitHub, and frequently attend technical community events. You also probably have a pet project or contribute to open-source projects.</p>

            <p>You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job <strong>without being religious</strong> about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and testing frameworks.</p>

            <p>You understand and <strong>embrace Agile</strong> processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work close to clients and Product Owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.</p>

            <p>Your are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of <strong>SOLID</strong> principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and <strong>D</strong>omain-<strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>esign to design applications that reflect the business domain.</p>

            <p>If you reached this point and believe that you satisfy all the criteria above, we are definitely <strong>interested to hear from you</strong>.<p>

            </br>

                <li>Mentor apprentices: You will be responsible for helping them to become craftsmen. Although the biggest part of this mentorship will happen during working hours, be prepared to spend extra hours on this.</li>

                <li>Give something back to the community, writing blogs, sharing code, giving talks, running workshops, and participating in external technical communities, specially the London Software Craftsmanship Community.</li>

                </li>
                <li>Link to your <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> account (or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>, <a href="https://code.google.com/">Google Code</a>, etc)</li>

            <h4>Second Phase</h4>

            <h4>Third Phase</h4>

            <p>If we liked your code, we will be inviting you in to meet us and to pair with us for a few hours. You will need to bring your own laptop with your favourite language and tools installed.</p>
