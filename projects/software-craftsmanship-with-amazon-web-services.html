	    <p>We needed a partner that could build a working event registration platform from scratch with a very strict deadline of 6 weeks. The platform had to be built on AWS using our serverless architecture principles and the partner therefore needed to have an excellent working knowledge of AWS services such as AWS RDS, AWS Lambda and AWS Cloudfront. Codurance understood the technical time which help us to spend more time on elaborating our features. The site was delivered in time and we we're more than happy to extend the application for larger UK events.</p>
