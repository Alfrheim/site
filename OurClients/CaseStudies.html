<h2> Curing the Agile Hangover </h2>
<p>This project started life with a waterfall process. The teams were divided by components with dedicated teams for business analysts and testing.</p>

<p>When we joined, the project had a number of issues including: Stagnate Skill set, Low Moral, Lots of Technical Debt, Unreliable and Costly Automated Tests, Unstable System, Unreliable Release Process and ineffective Off-shore teams.</p>

<p>We led a programme that focused on steadily improving the system as well as the team. We also brought the offshore teams closer to the point where they were considered an equal to the central on shore teams. For details please view the slides.</p>
