            <p>
              Functional Programming is not a new thing, however it has proved to be well-suited for modern
              challenges. Leading companies, libraries and developers have already moved into that paradigm and Scala
              is the winner in the JVM. Thanks to its seamless Java inter-operability and its hybrid approach with OOP,
              Java developers will find in Scala a familiar, but exciting, environment.

              One of the biggest critic of Scala is its complexity. This course will show the good parts of the language that
              will help you to create code so readable and maintanable that you will never want to go back to Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customers need the flexibility promised by Agile and without technical practices, that speed of delivery is
              compromised. Scala eliminates boilerplate and creates code that is easy to extend and reason about it. Scala focus on
              testability and type safety removes most of the bugs that developers battle every day in Java code. Scala is really
              convenient for Continuous Delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
              TDD is the best practice to discover this kind of language. During the course you will be focused on small
              exercises that will make you understand what is needed to craft real business applications.
