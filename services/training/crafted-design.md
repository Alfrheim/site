## About

This course is for experienced developers that want to get better at designing well-crafted solutions. It focuses on designing software that is responsive to changing requirements and new functionality, avoiding the pitfalls that lead to legacy code.

## Why attend?

* Learn design techniques applied in successful projects
* Use TDD as a design tool, applying Outside-In TDD
* Drive out a flexible design
* Build software that is not bound to a specific technology or framework by keeping them at the boundaries of your system
* Express your business domain in every facet of your entire application, not just methods and classes
* Keep your design clean as your application grows and requirements change
* Let your architecture emerge, rather than designing a rigid and unchangeable structure up-front

## Content

* Four elements of simple design
* Mapping and visualising business concepts in code
* SOLID principles
* Testing and refactoring legacy code to express business domain

* are familiar with at least one Object Oriented Language (such as Java and C#)
* are able to understand Java (the codebase and exercises are in Java)
* are comfortable using TDD to build software
* understand mock objects and know how to use a mocking library

## Prerequisites

Developers must:

* bring their own laptops
* have a development environment consisting of:
    *  Java 8
