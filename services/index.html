        <h4>Scenario 1:</h4> 
        <p>After a successful launch you now have a significant customer base, however new features are becoming increasingly slower to develop. Possibly, stability is also an issue—especially immediately after new releases.

        We will provide an initial assessment and embed craftsmen into your team to steadily increase the quality and flexibility of the system(s) so that your software can evolve at the same rate as your business.</p>

        <h4>Scenario 2:</h4> 
        <p>You have a great product in the inception phase and are looking for a CTO to help you develop, as well as drive, the future IT strategy of you business.

        We will allow you to delay the hiring of the CTO by providing advice and consultancy on hiring, technology choices and development practices. You can invest your initial capital on ‘makers’ who are actively developing the product under our guidance. We will also help hire the CTO at the right time. </p>

        <h4>Scenario 3:</h4> 
        <p>Your company has seen exceptional growth and with that the size of your codebase has also grown. It is getting to a point where the complexity has effectively halted change. 

        We will help you create an improvements roadmap that will focus on improving quality and removing barriers (process, technological and cultural) to change. 

        We realise that startup have limited access to funds. Hence we’ll provide competitive rates, sparingly using our senior craftsmen and by providing embedded craftsman who are actively mentored by the senior craftsmen from Codurance.

        <h4>Scenario 1: </h4>
        <p>You possibly have an in-house development team who do not have the capacity to build all the features in time for your business needs. 

        We will provide craftsmen who will work with your team to produce software with high quality and in time to suite the needs of your business.</p>

        <h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
        <p>You have a brand new project or a well defined piece of software that you need to outsource.

        We will provide a team of craftsmen to deliver an on-going or fixed scope piece of work. Ideally a team would be composed of 2 to 4 of our craftsmen and a Product Owner from your company. We will manage the day-to-day running of the team and can run the project on our own premises if required. </p>

        <p>Your teams have a mountain of technical debt. Your builds take hours and test cycles take days if not weeks. You release into production a handful of times in a year and every release brings a number of defects. 

        We will embed a senior craftsman who will help your teams improve their development processes by continuously training and  mentoring them in XP practices. The craftsman will also help them achieve measurable goals in a well defined improvements programme.</p> 

        <h4>Scenario 2:</h4>
        <p>You have continuous delivery and quality standards that must be met. 

        We will provide a an embedded craftsman to assess your current continous delivery and quality standard and help your team fill the gaps that may exist.</p>
