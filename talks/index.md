            <p>Craftsmanship: A Few Years On<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>It's been 12 years since Pete McBreen's book and 5 years since the Software Craftsmanship summit. So, what is the current state of Software Craftsmanship? If there is a Software Craftsmanship movement, where is it? What is it? Is it an elitist movement? Is Software Craftsmanship becoming a religion? Does it have a narrow focus? Is Software Craftsmanship just XP rebranded? Does it fit large organisations? In this presentation, Sandro will be talking about the current state of Software Craftsmanship, explaining its values and addressing some of its biggest criticisms.</p>

            <p>Software Craftsmanship<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>After over ten years since the Agile summit, software projects are still failing and developers are still behaving and being treated as factory workers. The software development industry is still very amateur when compared to other professions. How can we change this? Why Agile was not sufficient? Why so many clients are unhappy with their software projects? Why is it so difficult to find good developers? Our industry needs more professionalism and thatâ€™s what Software Craftsmanship brings to the table. In this talk Sandro will be explaining: what Software Craftsmanship really is, the value of technical practices, what it means to be a professional software developer and what to do to satisfy our customers.</p>

            <p>Testing and Refactoring Legacy Code<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>In this video, we take a piece of crappy Java code with no tests. Our objective is to write tests for it and then refactor to make it better. The code has the most common problems that much larger legacy applications have, like Singletons, static calls and feature envy. It also has some design problems. Fixing that is quite hard, mainly when we need to write all the tests before we start the refactoring. Another rule: We cannot change production code if it is not covered by tests but quite often we need to change the production code in order to be able to test it. How to solve this problem? Well, I hope I can answer all these questions in this video.

            <p>Curing Agile Hangover with Craftsmanship<p>
        </div>
        <div class="description">
             <p>Agile adoption brings into focus the shortcomings in the existing engineering practices. After undergoing an Agile transformation for a few years at UBS, where the focus was heavy on process and light on the technical disciplines, it is an understatement to say that we still have problems. We call this the Agile Hangover. Focusing on the technical practices is essential to a successful software project, regardless of the process. Software Craftsmanship principles have been essential in tackling the problems we face.</p>
             <p>In this talk we will share our experiences in how we are trying to find the right balance between technical practices and processes. Empowered professional software engineers, well defined testing strategy, process automation, high investment in people development, requirements management and strong emphasis on quality have been the key areas our focus.</p>
